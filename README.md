# Dynamic Credit - Web Application Developer assignment

I've hosted application on my local machine so it should be accessible via [this dynamic ip](http://95.180.30.150:8987/).

Database backup file along with stored procedures sql scripts can be found in Database folder.

The most difficult part for me was writing stored procedures for test db because I'm not sure I understanded requirements and logic behind them and this is the reason I must say that I am unsure about accuracy of data displayed on the UI.

## Unfinished tasks and further improvements

Here is list of assignments that I didn't finish in time and functionalities I would like to fix or improve:

- Tests – write more unit tests on both Back-End and Front-end.
- Database improvements – to add indexes based on results with 4M rows using SSMS execution plan and statistics.
- Extend database to 4M records and test performances.
- Search filters on Back-End - rethink implementation; current implementation is pretty coupled with lots of code smells.
- Search filters validation on client side. Add DateTime picker for date fields.
- Better implementation of graphs.
- Print whole page

Of course this and all other parts that I have not included in this list will be discussed on the interview.
